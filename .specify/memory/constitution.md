# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Educational Excellence
Every concept and explanation must be accessible to beginners while providing sufficient depth for intermediate learners; Content must include clear learning objectives, hands-on examples, and practical applications; All theoretical concepts must be paired with executable code examples and real-world implementations.

### II. Safety-First Approach
All hardware recommendations and experimental procedures must prioritize user safety; Clear safety warnings and risk assessments must accompany every hands-on activity; Documentation must include proper safety equipment requirements and emergency procedures.

### III. Reproducibility Standard
Every experiment, code example, and hardware setup must be fully reproducible with documented requirements; Complete bill of materials, assembly instructions, and configuration steps must be provided; All code examples must run consistently across standard development environments.

### IV. Open-Access Knowledge
Content must be freely accessible and reusable under appropriate open-source licenses; Hardware designs and software implementations must be shared with the community; Educational resources must remove barriers to entry for diverse learners.

### V. Technical Accuracy
All technical information must be fact-checked and validated through multiple authoritative sources; Mathematical derivations and engineering principles must be rigorously correct; Expert peer review must validate complex technical content before publication.

### VI. Modular Learning Architecture
Content must be organized in self-contained modules that can be consumed independently; Dependencies between topics must be clearly mapped and documented; Learners should be able to navigate the material based on their specific interests and skill levels.

## Development Standards

### Scope Definition
**In Scope:**
- Physical AI concepts and algorithms
- Humanoid robotics fundamentals (kinematics, dynamics, control)
- Mechanical design principles and fabrication techniques
- Electronics integration (sensors, actuators, embedded systems)
- Control theory and implementation
- Artificial intelligence applications in robotics
- Simulation environments and tools
- Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) principles
- Hands-on laboratory exercises and projects
- Hardware component lists and procurement guidance
- Circuit diagrams and mechanical drawings
- Software architecture patterns for robotics

**Out of Scope:**
- Advanced manufacturing techniques beyond hobbyist/fab lab capabilities
- Enterprise-scale industrial automation systems
- Military or defense applications
- Proprietary commercial robot platforms without educational licenses
- Medical robotics requiring specialized certifications
- Financial investment advice for robotics businesses

### Technology Stack Requirements
- Docusaurus as the primary documentation platform
- Markdown for content authoring
- JSON manifests for content metadata and navigation
- Claude CLI for automated content generation and processing
- Speckit Plus for project management and workflow automation
- Version control through Git with structured branching strategy
- Automated build and deployment pipelines

## Development Workflow

### Content Creation Process
All content must follow the Speckit Plus methodology: Specification → Plan → Tasks → Implementation cycle; Each chapter must include learning objectives, prerequisites, and assessment criteria; Peer review and expert validation must occur before content publication; Regular updates and maintenance schedules must be established for evolving technology topics.

### Quality Assurance
Technical content must undergo expert review by domain specialists; Code examples must be tested across multiple environments; Hardware recommendations must be verified for availability and cost-effectiveness; Accessibility compliance must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

### Collaboration Guidelines
Contributors must have demonstrated expertise in relevant robotics/AI domains; All contributions must align with educational mission and target audience; Clear attribution and licensing must be maintained for all shared resources; Community feedback mechanisms must be established and actively monitored.

## Governance

This constitution establishes the foundational principles that govern all aspects of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book development; All contributors must acknowledge and comply with these principles before participating; Amendments to this constitution require documented justification and approval by project leadership; Content decisions must align with the mission, audience, and quality standards outlined herein; All work must support the open-access, educational excellence, and safety-first principles.
